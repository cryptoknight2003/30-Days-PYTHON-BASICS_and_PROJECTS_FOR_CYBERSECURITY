'''Encrypting hashes doesn't make sense in the traditional sense, as hashes are meant to be one-way functions. Hashing is used to transform data into a fixed-size string of characters, which is useful for data integrity checks and password storage. Encryption, on the other hand, is a two-way process that can be reversed with the right key.

If you want to securely store sensitive information like passwords, you should use a secure hashing algorithm, like bcrypt or Argon2, and store the hash value, not the original password. Here's a simple example in Python using the bcrypt library to hash and verify passwords:

    Install the bcrypt library if you haven't already. You can install it using pip:

bash

pip install bcrypt

    Now, let's create a Python tool to hash and verify passwords:

python'''

import bcrypt

def hash_password(password):
    # Generate a salt and hash the password
    salt = bcrypt.gensalt()
    hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), salt)
    return hashed

def verify_password(hashed_password, input_password):
    # Check if the input password matches the stored hash
    return bcrypt.checkpw(input_password.encode('utf-8'), hashed_password)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Example usage
    password = "my_secret_password"

    # Hash the password
    hashed_password = hash_password(password)
    print("Hashed Password:", hashed_password)

    # Verify a password
    input_password = "my_secret_password"
    is_valid = verify_password(hashed_password, input_password)

    if is_valid:
        print("Password is valid.")
    else:
        print("Password is invalid.")

'''In this code:

    hash_password function generates a random salt and uses it to hash the provided password.
    verify_password function takes a stored hash and an input password, then checks if the input password matches the stored hash.

Remember to store and compare the hashed password values instead of the original passwords. This approach ensures that passwords are securely stored and verified without the need for decryption.'''
